  - name: Questions in Discourse
    slug: questions-in-discourse
    slot: 1
    subject: semantics
    description: >
      <p>Over the past 17 years, a good bit of work on discourse in Linguistics and Philosophy of Language presumes that a central pragmatic factor driving and constraining interpretation is the Question Under Discussion (QUD). The idea is central in the work of Ginzburg, van Kuppevelt and Roberts, and plays a part in work by Beaver, Büring, Jasinskaja, Kadmon, Pollard, Portner, van Rooij, Simons, and Zeevat, and their collaborators, inter alia; is closely related to the Inquisitive Semantics of Groenendijk and his colleagues; and is reflected more recently in an increasingly broad range of psycholinguistic research. This thread is also closely related to the extensive work on Planning Theory in AI (e.g. Cohen, Grosz & Sidner, Perrault, Stone, Thomason).
      </p>
      <p>This course will give students some background in the basic concepts and empirical motivation for this approach to discourse pragmatics, and suggest links to other theories of discourse, including those involving Rhetorical Structure Theory (like the SDRT of Asher and Lascarides, and the Coherence Theory of Kehler) and game theory (as in the work of philosophers like van Rooij). It will consist of five hours of lecture and discussion, including the following topics:
        <ul>
          <li>Basic empirical motivations: What kinds of problems in discourse pragmatics might benefit from the use of something like questions under discussion? As this is a very wide range of topics, we will focus mainly on anaphora resolution, focus, and presupposition projection, but will also include some discussion of the role of discourse particles in organizing and clarifying discourse.
          </li>
          <li>Basic concepts: What are questions and what role do they play in context? How are questions modeled in some of the theories of interest? How are theories involving the QUD related to classic theories of linguistic context, including the Common Ground-based contexts of Stalnaker, Kaplan’s contexts assigning values to dedicated indexicals, and theories using assignment functions or discourse referents for modeling constraints on anaphora resolution? How are questions in discourse related to alternative semantics, to the plans and goals assumed in Planning Theory?
          </li>
          <li>What does the QUD buy us from an explanatory point of view? How does the work which assumes its centrality in discourse essentially improve on earlier models of discourse context in linguistics and philosophy of language?
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>The goal of the course is to introduce students to the central issues and give a very brief overview of the literature and empirical results.
      <p>
      </p>
    prerequisites: >
      Students should understand the basics of formal, compositional semantics. And they should have a grasp of some of the basic topics in pragmatics, especially formal pragmatics and its relationship to dynamic theories of interpretation. Useful guides to the latter might be the papers in Steven Davis' (1991) <em>Pragmatics: A reader</em>; Nirit Kadmon's (2001) <em>Formal Pragmatics</em>; Lawrence Horn and Gregory Ward's (2006) <em>The Handbook of Pragmatics</em>; and papers in the bibliographic links associated with the topics at: <a href="http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~croberts/QUDbib/">http://www.ling.ohio-state.edu/~croberts/QUDbib/</a>.

          Craige Roberts is Professor of Linguistics at The Ohio State University. She specializes in formal semantics and pragmatics and her principal research interests are in:
          <ul>
          <li>Anaphora, definiteness, and specificity</li>
          <li>Formal models of context in interpretation: Presupposition, focus, implicature, perspective, and domain restriction</li>
          <li>The semantics and pragmatics of modality, mood, tense, and aspect</li>
          </ul>
          As a student Craige studied under Barbara H. Partee at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst. She then held a postdoctoral fellowship at CSLI at Stanford where she was exposed to interdisciplinary work on pragmatics in the tradition of Grice, and work on Planning Theory in AI. Her work on pragmatics is driven by her interest in the nature of the human mind, and it has resulted in a deepening dialogue with colleagues in computer science, logic, philosophy, and psychology. She is involved in an interdisciplinary Pragmatics Initiative at The Ohio State University and is currently collaborating with David Beaver, Mandy Simons, and Judith Tonhauser on the NSF-funded project Projective Meanings: presupposition, conventional implicature, and other non-assertoric aspects of utterance meaning.

  - name: Stochastic Lambda Calculus and its Applications in Cognitive Science
    slug: stochastic-lambda-calculus
    slot: 1
    subject: philosophy
    description: >
      <p>Logic and probability are key themes of cognitive science that have long had an uneasy coexistence. This course will introduce the stochastic lambda calculus, an extension of the standard lambda calculus into a system with probabilistic semantics. This provides a mathematical foundation for uniting logic and probability: compositional languages, that support reasoning by probabilistic inference. This general framework is realized in the probabilistic programming language Church, which we will use for hands on examples throughout the class.</p>
      <p>We will use Church to explore the basic principles of inference over structured probabilistic models, as they are relevant to modeling human cognition. These include explaining-away, the Bayesian Occam's razor, and learning-to-learn in hierarchical Bayesian models. Examples will be draw from various domains in cognitive science, including causal learning and language. We will then cover highlights from current frontiers in Bayesian modeling, including models of social cognition and rational process-level models. We will end with applications to natural language semantics and pragmatics.</p>
    prerequisites: none (but basic familiarity with probability and programming will help)

    slot: 3
    subject: compling
    description: The course will review central results from linguistics and cognitive psychology concerning the dimensions of affectivity and the ways in which attitudinal and emotional information is expressed in language. It will then focus on the computational extraction of such information from textual data using supervised and unsupervised methods. Special emphasis will be placed on bringing social and contextual information into the models and designing features that capture non-literal uses of language.
    prerequisites: "None, though students with programming skills will be happier and more productive in the class. Students can write to me with tips about how to prepare effectively."

  - name: "Possible Worlds: A Course in Metaphysics (for Computer Scientists and Linguists)"
    slot: 4
    subject: philosophy
    slug: possible-worlds
    description: >
      This course draws on science fiction stories and films, as well as readings in contemporary metaphysics, to introduce and explore key issues concerning time, causation and possibility. These three fundamental structuring concepts of human thought have &lsquo;faces&rsquo; in many disciplines of interest to NASSLLI participants (e.g., linguistics, logic and knowledge representation), but philosophical treatment of them arguably has a unique perspective to offer. Questions covered will include: &ldquo;Is time travel possible?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What makes now now?&rdquo;, &ldquo;Is backwards causation possible and if not, does that make fatalism true?&rdquo;, &ldquo;What makes statements about possibility true or false, anyway?&rdquo; Philosophers generally approach such questions by closely examining, analysing, and (last but not least) imaginatively exploring their underlying concepts in &lsquo;thought-experiments&rsquo;. This is the course's main methodology, though links will also be made via possible worlds semantics with some easy modal logic.
    prerequisites: Basic logic. Interest in philosophical discussion. Imagination.

    slot: 2
    subject: compling
    description: >
      Google translate can instantly translate between any pair of over fifty human languages (for instance, from French to English). How does it do that? Why does it make the errors that it does? And how can you build something better? Modern translation systems *learn* how to translate by reading millions of words of already translated text, and this course will show you how they work. Despite demonstrable success over the last decade, much work remains to be done, so we will also identify open questions at the heart of current research, as well as computational and linguistic insights that may help solve them. The course covers a diverse set of fundamental building blocks from linguistics, machine learning, algorithms, data structures, and formal language theory, along with their application to a real and difficult problem in artificial intelligence.

  - name: Social Choice Theory for Logicians
    slug: social-choice-theory
    slot: 4
    subject: logic
    description: >
      Social Choice Theory is the formal analysis of collective decision making. A growing number of logical systems incorporate insights and ideas from this important field. This course will introduce the key results (including proofs) and the main research themes of Social Choice Theory. The primary objective is to introduce the main mathematical methods and conceptual ideas found in the Social Choice literature. I will also pay special attention to recent logical systems that have been developed to reason about group decision making and how social choice-style analyses are being used by logicians. The course will not only provide a broad overview of the field of Social Choice from a logicians perspective, but will also discuss key technical results of particular interest to logicians. The main goal is to provide a solid foundation for students that want to incorporate results and ideas from Social Choice Theory into their field of study.
    prerequisites: >
      Basic (modal) logic would be helpful, but not necessary.   The course only requires some mathematical maturity (I will be going through some proofs).

      <p>This course will cover formal ontology and its application to tasks in
        deductive reasoning and computational linguistics.  Expressive formal
        ontologies, which employ first or higher order logic can be used as a
        more verifiable language than the ad-hoc languages used for expert
        systems in previous decades.  It is also becoming clear that to solve
        pragmatic issues in applying world knowledge to language understanding
        tasks, formal languages, and repositories of world knowledge are needed.
        This course addresses those applications.</p>
      <p>The course will be based on the open source Suggested Upper Merged
        Ontology (SUMO) and its associated open source Sigma knowledge
        engineering environment.  SUMO is the largest free ontology that
        includes substantial first and higher-order logic content.  The book
        "Ontology: A Practical Guide" will serve as the textbook for the course.</p>
      <p>Students completing the course will be prepared to start projects in
        creating formal domain ontologies for adding pragmatics to computational
        linguistic systems, design of large database schema and expert reasoning
        and decision support systems.</p>

      The course is an introduction to the basic techniques needed to analyze intensional constructions in terms of possible world semantics. After a short characterization of the core phenomena (substitutivity in attitude reports, de re/de dicto, unspecificity), the method of extension and intension is developed and applied to account for them. At the end of the week a few foundational issues (framework dependence, granularity) will be discussed.
    prerequisites: The course addresses students with a firm background in extensional (formal) semantics but little or no knowledge of intensional interpretation.

    slot: 1
    subject: logic
    description: >
      The problem of determining whether one sentence in a natural language intuitively follows from another -- in the sense that one could not accept the second without also being committed to the first -- would seem to require vast amounts of common sense and world knowledge to solve in general. However, a wide range of entailments seem to follow general patterns that arise from purely grammatical or surface considerations, e.g. from the way various functional, or logical, expressions combine with other words to make up complex expressions and sentences. Formal semantics has largely been concerned with characterizing, systematizing, and formalizing the subtleties of these compositional semantic phenomena, by translating fragments of natural language into familiar logical systems or by directly interpreting expressions model-theoretically. While entailment between sentences often serves a subsidiary role as a test or guide, characterizing entailment patterns per se is not typically the goal.<p>Over the past several decades, a number of researchers have taken up the challenge of defining logical systems whose syntax more closely mirrors that of natural language, e.g. by stating proof rules over (often syntactically parsed) natural language expressions themselves. This general project, sometimes called "natural logic", has been associated with a varied assortment of aims. First, some see the project as offering proposals for how phenomena studied in formal semantics could relate more closely to human psychology, e.g. dealing with mental representation and human inferential capacities. Second, a recent wave of exciting research has been motivated by the need to build efficient computational systems for reasoning about entailment between texts, the idea being that the top-down methodology of using surface information to guide inference may have advantages over full "deep level" interpretation in some cases. Finally, a third motivation is simply that the project gives rise to a number of interesting logical systems worthy of study in their own right. This course will survey a selection of this work, focusing on logical foundations, but also addressing applications and potential repercussions for philosophy and psychology of language, and computational semantics along the way.
    prerequisites: Basic familiarity with logic and lambda notation should be sufficient. The course is intended to be introductory and widely accessible.

    description: >
      We develop an integrated framework which addresses research issues in the semantics of dialogue, dialogue systems, logics of agents and linguistic work on spoken language.  We combine this with grammar, semantics (both lexical and phrasal) and principles of interaction. TTR (a version of type theory with records) is a framework which has pioneered an integrated formal treatment of interaction in language. The course will provide a practical introduction to semantic analysis using TTR, grounding its tools in empirical phenomena.
    prerequisites: A previous introduction to linguistics including formal syntax and formal semantics would be useful.

      <ul>
        <li>Lecture 1. The interactive stance: basic desiderata for a semantic theory; A theory of events and situations: frames and lexical semantics<p>
        The interactive stance to semantics moves to an analysis of semantics which can characterize the potential for misunderstanding, rejection, and correction. A theory of events and situations is developed which is related to Fillmore's theory of frames, the basis for a rich theory of lexical semantics.</li>
        <li>Lecture 2. Grammar in TTR; Incremental context and content; Tense and aspect<p>
        Grammars are introduced as assigning types to speech events. We show how the combination of frames and typing of speech events can be applied to a theory of tense and aspect related to Reichenbach's work on the relation between speech, event and reference times and more recent work by Tim Fernando on the analysis of events as strings of component events.</li>
        <li>Lecture 3. A theory of abstract entities and illocutionary interaction: analysis in terms of dialogue game boards; Negation<p>
        The semantic ontology is expanded to include abstract entities such as propositions, questions, and outcomes which underpin illocutionary interaction. This provides the background for an analysis of negation that combines aspects of classical, intuitionistic and situation semantics views.</li>
        <li>Lecture 4. Unifying metacommunicative and illocutionary interaction; Generalized quantifiers and copredication<p>
        We provide a unified theory of metacommunicative and illocutionary interaction on the basis of the notion of Austinian locutionary propositions. This provides a basis for describing various linguistic phenomena occuring during grounding and clarification interaction. Formal semantics has been traditionally concerned with questions concerning quantifiers such as 'every', 'most' and 'a few'.<p>
        We will show how these are treated in TTR and how the treatment relates to cases of copredication (originally discussed by James Pustejovsky) where we seem to be able to refer to different aspects of the same object simultaneously, e.g., 'The lunch was delicious but took forever' where 'lunch' appears to be used to simultaneously refer to food and an event. A rich theory of context emerges from these analyses and this is important for showing how fragmentary utterances can be interpreted.</li>
        <li>Lecture 5. Non-sentential utterances; Learning, coordination, multimodal interaction: describing interaction between parents and children during language acquisition<p>
        We will sketch current work in progress which suggests that the approach can serve as a basis for a theory of learning and multimodal interaction, enabling the semantic description of various aspects of interaction between parents and children during language acquisition.</li>

  - name: Inquisitive Semantics
    slug: inquisitive-semantics
    slot: 3
    subject: semantics
    description: >
      Inquisitive semantics develops a new notion of semantic meaning that directly reflects the use of language in exchanging information. The meaning of a sentence is not identified with its informative content, but rather with a proposal to update the common ground of a conversation in one or more ways. If a sentence proposes two or more alternative updates, then it is inquisitive, inviting other participants to choose between these alternative updates. If certain possible worlds are eliminated from the common ground by each of the proposed updates, then the sentence is informative. In this way, informative and inquisitive content are captured in a unified way, as two aspects of a single core notion of meaning. The aim of the course is to familiarize students and researchers with the framework, and to engage them in the further development of the logical-theoretical foundations, and the linguistic and computational applications. This is the perfect time for such engagement, since the fundamental building blocks of the framework are in place, the central research questions are clear, and the wide applicability of the framework can be illustrated with several concrete case studies. At the same time, many open questions remain and there is much room and demand for contributions from students and researchers in logic, linguistics, and computer science.
    prerequisites: Propositional logic, first-order logic.

    description: >
      The course will compare three main approaches to formal and computational semantics: model theory, proof theory, and distributional treatments of meaning (Vector Space Models). It will also consider ways of developing a probabilistic semantics for natural language. I will look at these approaches with respect to four main questions that an adequate theory of semantic representation must answer convincingly. First, how is lexical meaning integrated into the combinatorial procedures through which the interpretations of syntactically complex expressions are computed? Second, how is semantic entailment expressed in the theory? Third, how is the pervasive gradience of semantic properties captured? Finally, how can language learners acquire the class of representations that the theory makes available? These questions will be considered in the context of the guiding concern of computational semantics to develop robust, wide coverage systems for representing the semantic properties of natural languages, where these systems can be effectively learned and their representations of meanings can be efficiently computed.

    description: >
      Day in, day out, the semanticist checks types and simplifies terms. Can the digital computer help with these calculations? In fact, modern programming languages offer exactly the modularity features that make it easy to try fragments out and scale them up. To show how, we express so-called extensible interpreters as functional programs and apply the technique to natural-language semantics and logic. Specifically, we work our way from the simply typed lambda calculus and a context-free grammar to CCG and to a dynamic and continuation treatment of quantification and anaphora. Striving to be comprehensible and informative to both linguists and programmers, we use the programming language Haskell without assuming specific knowledge of it.
    prerequisites: None

      <p>Our plan for the course is to talk about syntax (context-free grammars, or CFG), semantics (Simple Theory of Types, or lambda-calculus) and a calculational way of relating the two. We start with a trivial fragment and show how to write derivations and re-interpret them in various ways: to spell them out or to compute a logical formula. We grow our fragments and interpreters in the second lecture: we add quantification, anaphora, subject relative clauses to our natural-language fragment; we add state to the semantic calculus; we add the interpretation of a sentence as an imperative program performing an information &ldquo;update&rdquo;.

    subject: logic
    description: >
      <p>In this course I will motivate and introduce hybrid logic, a form of modal logic in which reference to worlds (or times, or epistemic states, or ordinary individuals, or...) is possible. The key idea traces back to work by Arthur Prior, the inventor of tense logic, from the 1960s, and (in the very last lecture) I will discuss some of Prior's concerns. But the main aim of the course  is to progressively introduce the main components of hybrid logic, to see how they all fit together, and to learn how to work with them both semantically and proof theoretically.</p>
      <p>This is a course in formal logic, and so I will be presupposing that participants have had some prior exposure to logic (propositional logic, first-order logic) and are comfortable with formal techniques such as inductive definitions. But I am aiming to make the course relatively self-contained. If you have encountered modal logic before, you should not have any difficulties with this course. But even if you haven't, I hope to make the main line of development accessible. The key ideas are remarkably straightforward, and I will try to present them in a way which makes this clear.</p>

  - name: "Meaning as Use: Indexicality, Expressives, and Self-Reference"
    slug: meaning-as-use
    slot: 2
    subject: philosophy
    description: >
      <p>The slogan 'meaning is use', usually attributed to Wittgenstein,
        captures the insight that for many expressions of natural language,
        semantic theory should state rules of use rather than-- or in addition
        to-- specifying the concept or logical translation associated with the
        expression.   This workshop aims to explore current and evolving ideas
        about this use-dependent aspect of language and its connections with
        other domains.  For indexicals such as 'I', 'you', and 'now', "the
        referent is dependent on the context of use and the word provides a
        rule which determines the referent in terms of certain aspects of the
        context" (Kaplan).  Self-reference is a special case of indexicality
        that presents its own set of puzzles (Kamp, Anand), and also bears
        connections to expressive content and evidentials. Expressives like
        'damn' and 'bastard' convey important affective content in a special
        way that differs from the presentation of descriptive content (Potts).
         Evidential markers indicate the source or nature of the evidence for
        the information in a sentence in a way that is closely tied to
        self-ascription (McCready, Murray).  In this workshop we explore a
        variety of topics and the connections between them, with presentations
        and discussion by leading contributors to this field.</p>

      <img class="float-left" style="margin: 0 20px 10px 0" src="/images/150/hans-kamp.jpg" />
      <h3>Hans Kamp (The University of Texas &amp; Universität Stuttgart)</h3>
      <p>In this talk we will assume (i) that mental representation of content
        generally involves an ‘indexical’ singular term ‘n’, which represents
        the ‘psychological present’, and (ii) that when the thought is a
        self-ascription (a ‘thought de se’), its representation also involves
        an ‘indexical’ singular term ‘i’, representing the self.
      <p>The occurrence of ‘i’ in the representation of a thought that a
        speaker wants to express in words licenses her use of the first person
        pronoun ‘I’; but her use of ‘I’ will produce in her addressee the
        representation of a de re ascription to her. (‘you’ produces
        discrepancies of the opposite kind; its use is licensed when the
        speaker puts a thought into words that is a de re ascription to the
        addressee, but will provoke the addressee into constructing the
        representation of a self-ascription.)
      <p>In a somewhat analogous way, the presence of ‘n’ in the mental
        representation of a speaker guides her choice of tenses and temporal
        adverbs, but the temporal information carried by these sentence
        elements can be reconverted to the same representational form that
        gave rise to them: speaker and addressee share their psychological
        present (at least in face-to-face conversation) and can represent it
        using the same forms.
      <p>The interactions between the mental indexicals ‘i’ and ‘n’ on the one
        hand and the linguistic indexicals ‘I’, ‘you’ and the tenses and
        temporal adverbials on the other merit careful scrutiny. This is true
        in particular when the thoughts that are being communicated between
        speaker and addressee involve nested attitude attributions – as when
        the speaker thinks, and ventures to say to the addressee, that she
        thinks that he does not like her.
      <p>The talk will present the forms of the representations, discuss the
        ways in which these representations can be converted into words and in
        which those words can in their turn be reconverted into mental
        representations by the recipient, with special attention to the nested
        embeddings mentioned above.

      <h3>Pranav Anand (University of California at Santa Cruz)</h3>
      <p>The structure of imagistic attitudes like memory and imagination has received a great deal of attention in philosophy.  For example, Berkeley (1710) and Nagel (1974) asked whether there are limits to our imaginative capacities and Williams (1973) asked if such imagistic experiences have an explicit 'perspective' or 'self' that orients the perception or pseudo-perception.</p>
      <p>A linguistic question that arises is whether such perspectival information affects the truth conditions of ascriptions of memory and imagination. Vendler (1982) and Higginbotham (2003) explicitly say yes, focusing on examples with and without PRO, such as Vendler's 'I imagined swimming in the ocean' and 'I imagined myself swimming in the ocean'.</p>
      <p>In this talk, I will argue that whatever perspectival distinctions we may wish to make in imagistic attitudes, they do not map cleanly onto obligatorily de se attitudes. Rather, I will argue that perspective arises either from the context-dependent nature of the expressions in question or constraints that imagistic experiences themselves bring to the table.</p>

      <img class="float-left" style="margin: 0 20px 10px 0" src="/images/150/sarah-murray.jpg" />
      <h3>Sarah Murray, Cornell University</h3>
      <p>In this talk I discuss the indexical properties of evidential markers and how they compare to other indexicals. Based on this comparison, I argue that there are two kinds of indexical expressions found in natural language: pure indexicals and anaphoric indexicals. Pure indexicals, after Kaplan 1978, are exemplified by first person pronouns in English and Cheyenne (Algonquian: Montana). Anaphoric indexicals are exemplified by the reportative evidential in Cheyenne, roughly similar to the evidential adverb reportedly in English. Like the first person pronouns, both the Cheyenne reportative and English reportedly are anchored to the speaker in declarative sentences, discourse initially and discourse internally.  For all of them, a change in the speaker affects the content of the sentence. However, in questions, the Cheyenne reportative and English reportedly are anchored to the addressee, unlike the first person pronouns. Examples such as evidentials in questions show that despite the strong similarities between first person pronouns and evidentials, they cannot be represented in exactly the same way. At the same time, their strong overlap must be accounted for.
      <p>This talk will also present an analysis of these two different kinds of indexicals where pure indexicals are analyzed a la Kaplan 1978 as referring to the context of utterance, represented by the speech event. The first person pronoun, for example, refers to the agent of the speech event. Anaphoric indexicals are analyzed as referring to the currently topical event. By default, in unembedded, declarative cases, the currently topical event is the speech event, the agent of which is the speaker. However, the topical event can change, depending on particular constructions in particular languages, yielding a restricted set of other individuals that the anaphoric indexicals can refer to. A formalization of this analysis is given in an update semantics with sequence based anaphora. This analysis accounts for the fact that by default anaphoric indexicals and pure indexicals refer to the same individuals. However, in questions or embedded cases, when the topical event changes, they refer to different individuals. In addition, this analysis accounts for the fact that Cheyenne reportatives are limited to secondhand reports.

      <h3>Eric Acton (Stanford)<br> Christopher Potts (Stanford) </h3>
      <p>Lakoff (1974) argues that affective demonstratives in English are
          markers of solidarity and shared sentiment, and that they can in turn
          be used to foster, reinforce, or tacitly insist upon a sense of common
          ground between a speaker and her audience.  We will present
          quantitative corpus evidence that these affective uses are prevalent
          and robust, not only in English, but also in German and Japanese, and
          that similar effects are found with personal pronouns.  The question
          then arises of where these affective, social meanings come from.  Do
          they represent a semantic ambiguity, or can they be derived
          pragmatically?  We will argue for a pragmatic approach.  Specifically,
          we will seek to show that affective uses of this sort are expected on
          the theory of Elbourne (2008), in which both personal pronouns and
          demonstratives require the speaker and hearer to coordinate on
          contextually supplied properties and referential indices.  These
          requirements draw on, and hence evoke the common ground that exists
          between speaker and hearer.
