<h4><i>November, 2011</i></h4>

<p>NASSLI 2012 developments continue apace. First, I'm happy to announce two new speakers:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bonnie Webber</strong> from the University of Edinburgh, best known for her highly influential NLP work on discourse and dialogue systems, will give an evening lecture during the main school.</li>
  <li><strong>Martin Davis</strong>, Professor Emeritus at NYU, a central figure in the development of computability theory and a student of Alonzo Church's, will give one of the presentations at the Turing Symposium celebrating the centenary of Turing's birth.</li>
</ul>
