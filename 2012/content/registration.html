<p><strong>Important:</strong> please read the following notes on registration.
  <ul>
    <li>You must select a quantity of exactly 1 when adding a ticket to your cart. If you are registering more than one person, you must go through the checkout once for each ticket (so that we get each individual's information).</li>
    <li>If you are a UT student/faculty, the checkout process will require you to login with your UT EID via a pop-up window, so <strong>be sure to allow pop-ups!</strong></li>
  </ul>

<h3>UT Students</h3>

<p>A UT EID is required for UT students and faculty who register at the reduced rate or as volunteers.</p>

<h3>Non-UT Students</h3>

<p>A UT EID is not required to register at the academic or professional rate. Non-UT registrants should use the "Quick Checkout" option, which is on the left, opposite the "Checkout with EID" link, and kind of grayed-out.</p>

<p>All second round scholarship applicants should register for the school.  If granted a scholarship, your fees will be refunded and you will be eligible for an additional payment of up to $300 against certified travel and accommodation expenses.  You should apply for the scholarship by following instructions on the <a href="/scholarships"><strong>scholarship application page</strong></a>.  If you previously applied for a scholarship in our first round (before February 28), but were either not granted one, or received only a fee reduction, your name will automatically be entered into the competition for second round scholarships.</p>
