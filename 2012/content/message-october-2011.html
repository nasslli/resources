<p>
The big news is that the <a href="/committee">NASSLLI Program Committee</a>, led by <a href="http://www.cs.bham.ac.uk/~vdp/">Valeria de Paiva</a> and Carlos Areces, has put together a fantastic program of classes on interdisciplinary topics in CS, Philosophy, Linguistics, Psychology, and allied fields. Courses are targeted at graduate students as well as industrial attendees, postdocs, faculty, and advanced undergraduates. So mark your diaries! The school will be opening for registration in a few weeks. Watch this space for more information, or sign up for our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=300928343266509">Facebook event</a>, Google+ (coming soon!), and <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/nasslli">Twitter feed</a>.
