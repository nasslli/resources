<h2>On Campus Accommodation</h2>

<h3>Can I stay on campus?</h3>
<p>Yes.  We have reserved a block of rooms in the San Jacinto Residence Hall.  As of June 14, rooms are still available.</p>

<h3>Do San Jacinto Residence Hall rooms have private bathrooms and showers?</h3>
<p>Yes, each room has its own bathroom and shower.</p>

<h3>What's the cost of accommodation in the San Jacinto Residence Hall?</h3>
<p>A single occupancy room is $70 per night, and a double occupancy room is $35 per person per night.</p>

<h3>Can I share a double occupancy room with my significant other?</h3>
<p>It's complicated.</p>

<p>If you are married to your significant other, yes.  Simply complete a roommate request for your spouse.</p>

<p>If you are the same gender as your significant other, yes.  Simply complete a roommate request for your significant other.</p>

<p>If you are not the same gender as your significant other and you are unmarried, then no, you cannot share a double occupancy room with your significant other.  We're told that this policy exists because the San Jacinto Residence Hall receives public funding from the state of Texas.</p>

<h3>I'd like a double room, but I am travelling alone.  What can I do?</h3>
<p>Simply reserve a double room without supplying a roommate request.  You will be automatically paired with another NASSLLI participant of the same gender.<p>

<h3>I'm arriving on June 15/16/17.  What time is check-in?  How does it work?</h3>
<p>The official check-in interval is from 1pm to 9pm daily.  However, we're told that guests may check-in until the outer doors lock at 11pm.</p>
<p>Enter the residence hall through the main doors.  Tell the residence hall staff member at the front desk that you have a reservation with NASSLLI.</p>

<h3>Where are the main doors to the San Jacinto Residence Hall?</h3>
<p>The main doors are located on the west side of the building (opposite San Jacinto Boulevard).  If you walk uphill on 21st (i.e., west, which happens to be the only direction you can walk on 21st), you will see a pedestrian boulevard on your left.  It will lead you to the main entrance to the residence hall.</p>

<h3>I'm departing on June 22/23/24/25.  What time is check-out?  How does it work?</h3>
<p>You must complete check-out prior to 2pm on the day of your departure.  You should check-out with a residence staff member at the front desk.</p>

<h3>How do I get from the residence hall to the UTC?</h3>
<p>Walk west on 21st Street (up the hill).  After you pass Speedway, look for the UTC escalators on your left, just past the large library.</p>

<h2>Off-Campus Accommodation</h2>

<h3>Can I stay off-campus with a local host?</h3>
<p>We have provided hosts for a small number of participants.  However, we have now exhausted our supply of hosts.  An alternative for the adventurous spirit is <a href="www.couchsurfing.org">couchsurfing.org</a>.  If you choose to stay off campus, be sure to consider your transportation options.</p>

<p>See the <a href="accommodations.html">accommodations page</a> for more details.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Transportation</h2>

<h3>I'm an instructor or invited speaker.  How do I get from the airport to my lodging (and vice versa)?</h3>
<p>If you would like to request a ride from a volunteer, send an email to support@nasslli2012.com with the subject line "Airport transportation request" and include your flight numbers and arrival/departure dates and times.</p>
<p>Otherwise, taxis and buses are available (see immediately below for details).</p>

<h3>I'm a participant.  How do I get from the airport to my lodging (and vice versa)?</h3>
<p>If you're staying on campus, you're in luck.  The "Airport Flyer" (Bus #100) will take you from the airport directly to the San Jacinto Residence hall.  Your stop is 21st and San Jacinto.  Cost is $1.</p>
<p>If you're staying off campus, you might use Google maps or the Capital Metro site to plan a bus route. Otherwise, taxis are available at the airport.  Expect to pay around $30 for a taxi from the airport to central Austin.</p>

<h3>How do I get around town?</h3>
<p>Use Google Maps or the Capital Metro site to plan bus routes.  Or rent a bike.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Packing</h2>

<h3>How should I dress?</h3>
<p>Dress comfortably.  Wear good walking shoes.  Plan for temperatures from roughly 70-100F (20-40C).  If we're lucky we'll have occasional cool breezes and brief showers.  It's a good idea to bring an umbrella; if it doesn't rain, you can use it for shade.</p>

<h3>Should I bring a swim suit?</h3>
<p>Why not?</p>

<h3>What else?</h3>
<p>A canteen for water and a travel mug for coffee and tea.</p>

<p>A combination lock, if you've got one.  There are lockers in the UTC, but if you want to store your valuables there (say, while you're at lunch), you must provide your own combination lock.</p>

<p>And if you hope to rent or borrow a bicycle, you should bring bike lights, a helmet and whatever other gear you want to use.  Most bike rental services will provide a bike lock.</p>
