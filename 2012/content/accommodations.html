<!--Accommodations-->

<p>All NASSLLI participants are responsible for securing their own accommodations during their stay in Austin (including scholarship recipients).  However, the following resources will be helpful as participants plan their stay.</p>

<h3><a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/index.php?id=130&scode=4&site=1">San Jacinto Residence Hall</a></h3>

<p>NASSLLI participants may request accommodation in the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/student/housing/index.php?id=130&scode=4&site=1">San Jacinto Residence Hall</a> on the University of Texas campus.</p>

<p>Web-registration is now available. Email <strong>support@nasslli2012.com</strong> with the subject line "Residence hall info request" to receive instructions for residence hall registration.  Note that NASSLLI does not guarantee the availability of accommodations in the San Jacinto Residence Hall.</p>


<p>Single occupancy rooms are $70 per night.  Double occupancy rooms are $35 per person per night.  Both single and double occupancy rooms have private bathrooms.
Participants who register for a double-occupancy room may request a particular roommate during the registration process or may request to be automatically paired with another NASSLLI participant seeking a roommate.</p>

<p>Note that the San Jacinto Residency Hall receives public funding from the State of Texas and cannot provide double-occupancy rooms to unmarried male-female couples.  Such couples are encouraged to contact <strong>support@nasslli2012.com</strong> to discuss their options.<p>
