<h3><i>June 8, 2012</i></h3>
 
<p>All systems are go here at NASSLLI HQ! Summer school blast-off is just over a week away, with <a href="/bootcamp">Bootcamp Courses</a> beginning at 1pm on Sat June 16.  We now have 200 participants signed up for what promises to be the most Logic, Language and Information packed week that Texas has ever seen. While we've reached our target numbers, there's still space, and you can register <a href="http://nasslli2012.com/registration">here</a>. If you have any questions about registration, or any other issue, please email <a href="mailto:nasslli@nasslli2012.com">nasslli@nasslli2012.com</a>

<p><b>Second round scholarships:</b> In addition to the 50 scholarships and 27 fee reductions that were announced in March, we can now announce the availability of at least 12 additional last-minute scholarships. To apply for a scholarship, go to our <a href="/registration">registration page</a>.

<p><b>Weekend conferences:</b> Registered NASSLLI participants get free registration for all three weekend conferences, not only the <a href="/turing">Turing Centenary Symposium</a>, but also the
         <a href="/rain">Reasoning and Interaction at NASSLLI (RAIN)</a> and
         <a href="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~tls/2012tls/">TLS&nbsp;<img src="/images/ext-orange.png" /></a> conferences. Full programs are going live as I write!

<p><b><a href="/evenings">Evening events:</a></b> Evening events at NASSLLI will include plenary lectures by Bonnie Webber  (University of Edinburgh) and Michael Tye (UT Philosophy), and the Turing Centenary Symposium with talks by Mike Knight (USC), Bob King (UT), and cyberpunk novelist Bruce Sterling. There will also be a welcome reception on Tuesday June 19 at Scholz Garten, and on the final Friday of the school a party at Cafe Medici. Last big announcement:  the Friday party will include live music from the Linguistic Department's amazing dance-til-you-drop band, <i>Gavagai</i>... and just maybe one or two surprise guests.

<p>Looking forward to meeting you all,</p>
