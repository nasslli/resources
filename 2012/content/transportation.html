<!-- Transportation -->



<p>Participants are strongly encouraged to consider transportation to and from campus and in particular, the University Teaching Center (UTC), before booking a hotel or making other arrangements to stay off-campus.  

<h3>Transit</h3>

Visit <a href="http://www.capmetro.org/">Capital Metro</a> (or <a href="http://goo.gl/maps/0ouJ">Google Maps</a>) to find bus routes.</p>

<p><a href="http://capmetro.org/riding/fares_2.asp">Capital Metro fares and tickets are available here</a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/parking/transportation/shuttle/routes/">free UT shuttles</a> will be running on the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/parking/transportation/shuttle/calendar/">summer schedule</a>:</p>

<h3>Car</h3>
<p>If you are arriving by car, you should have a plan for parking near campus.  UT has a number of <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/parking/parking/garages/index.php">paid parking garages</a> with <a href="http://www.utexas.edu/parking/parking/garages/daily-rates.html">hourly rates</a>.  The Brazos Garage is quite close to the UTC.</p>
<p>Another option quite close to the UTC is the privately owned<a href="http://shopdobie.com/page/o198/Parking.html">Dobie garage</a>, at $12 per day.</p>

<p>Free parking is available at the <a href="http://www.capmetro.org/riding/current_schedules/MAPS/park&ridelocations.pdf">Park &amp; Ride</a> at the Triangle or North Lamar Transit Center. Buses 1L, 1M or 101 (southbound) have stops at Guadalupe and 21st, just a short walk away from the UTC and other areas of interest to NASSLLI participants.</p>

<h3>Bicycle</h3>

<p>Austin is a bike friendly town, though during the summer it's not so pleasant to ride during the heat of the day.  Mornings and evenings are very nice for cycling, however.</p>
<p>Bike rentals are available.  <a href="http://www.austinbiketoursandrentals.com/">Austin Bike Rentals</a> will deliver bikes.  While their website doesn't say so, it is possible to rent at a weekly rate (roughly $100), which includes free lights, lock and helmet.</p>
