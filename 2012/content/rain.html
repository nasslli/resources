<h3>Overview</h3>

<!-- <p>Reasoning and Interaction at NASSLLI (RAIN)  is a workshop to be held immediately after the upcoming North American Summer School of Logic, Language, and Information (NASSLLI).</p> -->

<p>Reasoning and Interaction at NASSLLI (RAIN) is a workshop concluding the summer school, to be held Saturday and Sunday, June 23-24.   Featuring talks by NASSLLI instructors, participants and other visiting scholars whose work is related to  reasoning and/or interactions among individuals and groups, RAIN is a forum for the presentation of formally-minded work of wide interest to an interdisciplinary audience.</p>

<!-- 
<h4>Topics</h4>

<p>We invite submission on topics such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>models of human reasoning
  <li>philosophy of modal logic
  <li>logic motivated by cognitive science
  <li>rationality and bounded rationality
  <li>epistemic logic and interactive epistemology
  <li>foundational aspects of game theory
  <li>modal logic and game theory
  <li>spatial and temporal reasoning
</ul>

<p>Papers on related subjects will also be considered.</p>
 -->

<!-- <h4>Paper Submission</h4>
<p>We invite papers for presentation at RAIN.   
We are most interested in substantial papers on the topics mentioned above,
including presentations of work which has already been published.
RAIN will not publish a volume of papers, and so we shall also consider 
work which is substantial but "in progress."
The submissions should be at most 5 pages, with an optional technical
appendix of up to 10 pages, together with a plain-text abstract of 100-200
words.
Papers should be submitted electronically to <a href="https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rain2012">https://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rain2012</a>.

<!-- 
<h4>Co-occuring workshops</h4>

<p>The TLS (Texas Linguistics Society) conference will coincide with RAIN, but they are two different events. TLS will be open to submissions from all areas, but the keynotes and invited talks will be split between semantics (potentially specifically the semantics of questions) and meaning in signed languages. In terms of overgeneralized differences, RAIN is oriented more toward logic/philosophy, and TLS is oriented more toward linguistics.</p>

<h4>Registration</h4>

<p>RAIN is open to all NASSLLI participants.  There is no registration fee or independent registration process.</p>

<h4>Organizing Committee</h4>

<p>David Beaver, Patrick Blackburn, Larry Moss</p>
