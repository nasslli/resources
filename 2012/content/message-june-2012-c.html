<h2>DIRECTORS' NEWSFLASH</h2>

<p>Dear NASSLLI people, welcome to Austin!!!</p>

I'm looking forward to seeing all 214 of you at our two opening evening events tonight:
<ul>
  <li>Bonnie Webber's talk at 7:30pm will be in the UTC the same building that the classes are in, but on the ground floor, 2.102A.
  <li>Right after that we'll have reception. We've reserved Cafe Medici on Guadalupe & 21st from 8:30pm â€” everyone is invited for a well-deserved drink, and optionally to engage in building a lego Turing machine. You, know, geeky ice breaker sort of a thing.
</ul>
